# EmpiricalEvidence
This package has functions for computing empirical distributions. It has thre functions, namely cum.dist, ltp, and quantile.f.

cum.dist cumputes the empirical distribution of a numeric vector.

quantile.f cumputes the quantile function by using the generalized inverse function

ltp cumputes the mean cumultaive distribution by using the law of total probability
